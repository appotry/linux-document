我是在Ubuntu上安装 TeamViewer,因此我选择下载 .deb 文件. 双击下载的包就会弹出图形化的安装界面,按照指示一步步下去就行了.

若你遇到有依赖问题, 我建议你试着用 [[https://itsfoss.com/gdebi-default-ubuntu-software-center/][GDebi package installer]] 来安装.

另外, 如果你更喜欢终端操作, 可以进入下载目录然后运行下面命令:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  sudo dpkg -i teamviewer*

如果由于缺少依赖而导致安装失败, 则输入下面命令.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  sudo apt-get install -f
#+END_SRC

安装好后, 你就可以从应用菜单中打开 TeamViewer 了,或者也可以在控制台运行下面命令:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  teamviewer
#+END_SRC

* How to use TeamViewer on Linux to connect to other systems

Here are a few things you should know about using TeamViewer for remotely connecting to other systems:

+ Both host and target systems should have TeamViewer installed.
+ Host and target can be any supported operating systems. For example, you can use it to connect to a Windows system from your Linux system.
+ By default, each system is given an ID and a 4 digit password that is generated randomly at each start of the application.
+ If you are trying to connect to a remote system, you’ll need to know the ID and the password of the target system.
+ Similarly, if you are giving someone access to your system, you need to provide them the password and ID of your system to the remote system.
+ Both systems must be connected to the internet.
+ You are not required to create an account on TeamViewer to use it.

Now that you know a few things, let’s see how to do it:

** Step 1

Start TeamViewer on both host and target systems. You’ll see the ID and password of your TeamViewer application on your screen. Similar
info will be displayed on the remote system.

This is important information as it will be required to make the remote desktop connection.

An ID and Password is displaced on the screen

** Step 2

For connecting to a system, both the host and target machines should have TeamViewer installed. You will need the unique ID and password
of the system to which you want to connect to. Open TeamViewer and under the “Remote Control” type in the ID in Partner ID option, and
click on “Connect to partner”:

Enter the ID of the target device

Quite obviously, it will ask you to enter the password of the target system.

Once you enter the correct password and hit Log On, you should be immediately connected to the target system.

** Step 3

Once connected, you have the full control of the target system. I have a system running Ubuntu from which I established a remote desktop
connection to another system running Elementary OS and then I ran a command there!

The top bar provides different options for TeamViewer. Under the Actions tab, you can find options to end the session, reboot your device
or even invite additional participants.

View tab contains the most useful options. You can select the screen fit, optimize speed and quality and select the screen resolution for
the target system.

Files & Extras gives you the option to take a screenshot or record a session. You can share a file between the two system via drag and
drop or using the file manager.

* Do more with TeamViewer

There are ways to optimize your TeamViewer experience. Let’s see some of them.

** 1. Using TeamViewer account for easy access

TeamViewer provides an ID and password which can be used to take control of your system. However, signing up for a free user lets you
store these credentials, and quickly connect to a system without the hassle of typing it every time.

** 2. Recording a session

You can always record a TeamViewer session for a later access or for the records. Once you are connected to TeamViewer, navigate to Extras
in the Toolbar and you will find the option to start, pause and stop recording. Once a recording is done, you are prompted to save it.

** 3. Multiple Sessions support

TeamViewer supports multiple sessions simultaneously, you can take control of a second system without being disconnected from the first
one. Click on the + sign in the top left corner to add another machine. For IT support people, this can be very useful. 

** 4. Easy file transfer

You can share a file by selecting File Transfer from the TeamViewer toolbar. You can either select the file which you want to share, or
drag and drop a file using option File box. This is important since you can push an application to the target machine and install it
without having a physical access.

** 5. Manage Visual Settings

Visual Settings options lets you optimize your connection to the target machine by giving you options to choose the Quality, Scaling,
Screen resolution. It can be accessed via View option. In case there is a lag, you could select Optimize speed under Quality options, or
disable GUI animations.

** 6. Connect with a smartphone

TeamViewer app is available for iOS, Android and Windows 10 Mobile which can help you take a look at your system anywhere, anytime. This
lets me access my system and check if some downloads are completed, or even change the music track without reaching out to my system. 

I tried taking a control of my system with my Phone and it worked like a charm.

* Final Words on TeamViewer

TeamViewer is a great tool when it comes to getting control of someone’s system for troubleshooting or monitoring your own system with
your mobile handset. And since it is available for almost every platform, there’s always a way around to help someone by connecting to
their system.
