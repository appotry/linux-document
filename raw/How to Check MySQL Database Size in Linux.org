In this article, I will show you how to check the size of MySQL/MariaDB databases and tables via the MySQL shell. You will learn how to determine the real size of a
database file on the disk as well as size of data that it present in a database.

By default MySQL/MariaDB stores all the data in the file system, and the size of data that exists on the databases may differ from the actual size of Mysql data on
the disk that we will see later on.

In addition, MySQL uses the information_schema virtual database to store information about your databases and other settings. You can query it to gather
information about size of databases and their tables as shown.

# mysql -u root -p
MariaDB [(none)]> SELECT table_schema AS "Database Name", 
ROUND(SUM(data_length + index_length) / 1024 / 1024, 2) AS "Size in (MB)" 
FROM information_schema.TABLES 
GROUP BY table_schema;

Check MySQL Database Size

To find out the size of a single MySQL database called rcubemail (which displays the size of all tables in it) use the following mysql query.

MariaDB [(none)]> SELECT table_name AS "Table Name",
ROUND(((data_length + index_length) / 1024 / 1024), 2) AS "Size in (MB)"
FROM information_schema.TABLES
WHERE table_schema = "rcubemail"
ORDER BY (data_length + index_length) DESC;

Check Size of MySQL Database

Finally, to find out the actual size of all MySQL database files on the disk (filesystem), run the [[https://www.tecmint.com/check-linux-disk-usage-of-files-and-directories/][du command]] below.

# du -h /var/lib/mysql
