Like [[https://www.tecmint.com/google-commandline-search-terminal/][Googler]] (Google Site Search from the command-line), ddgr is a command line utility
that can be used to search for key terms words via DuckDuckGo search engine and a
[[https://www.tecmint.com/command-line-web-browsers/][command line browser]] on your terminal prompt. 

Before installing ddgr command line search engine in Linux, first assure that the Python
3.4 and Python requests library needed to handle HTTPS requests are installed on your
system, by issuing the following commands.

------------------ On CentOS, RHEL & Fedora ------------------ 
# yum install epel-release
# yum install python34 python34-requests
------------------ On Debian & Ubuntu ------------------
# apt install python3 python3-requests

In order to open ddgr searches you need to install a command line browser, such as elinks,
links, lynx, w3m or www-browser, in your system.

In this guide we’ll configure ddgr search engine to open links via lynx text based browser.

# yum insall lynx         [On CentOS, RHEL & Fedora]
# apt-get install lynx    [On Debian & Ubuntu]

Next, set the BROWSER environment variable system-wide to point to lynx browser, by
issuing the following commands with root privileges.

# export BROWSER=lynx
# echo “export BROWSER=lynx” >> /etc/profile
