In Unix-like operating systems, a man page (in full manual page) is a documentation for a terminal-based program/too/utility (commonly known as a command). It
contains the name of the command, syntax for using it, a description, options available, author, copyright, related commands etc.

You can read the manual page for a Linux command as follows; this will display the man page for the [[https://www.tecmint.com/how-to-check-disk-space-in-linux/][df command]]:

$ man df

By default, the man program normally uses a terminal pager program such as [[https://www.tecmint.com/linux-more-command-and-less-command-examples/][more or less]] to format its output, and the default view is normally in white color for
every kind of text (bold, underlined etc..).

You can make some tweaks to your ~/.bashrc file to get nicely colored man pages by specifying a color scheme using various LESS_TERMCAP variables.

$ vi ~/.bashrc

Add following color scheme variables.

export LESS_TERMCAP_mb=$'\e[1;32m'
export LESS_TERMCAP_md=$'\e[1;32m'
export LESS_TERMCAP_me=$'\e[0m'
export LESS_TERMCAP_se=$'\e[0m'
export LESS_TERMCAP_so=$'\e[01;33m'
export LESS_TERMCAP_ue=$'\e[0m'
export LESS_TERMCAP_us=$'\e[1;4;31m'

Following are the color codes that we used in the above configuration.

,* 31 – red 
,* 32 – green 
,* 33 – yellow 

And here are the meanings of the escape codes used in the above configuration.

,* 0 – reset/normal 
,* 1 – bold 
,* 4 – underlined 

You can additionally reset your terminal by typing reset or even start up another shell. Now when you try to view a man page [[https://www.tecmint.com/how-to-check-disk-space-in-linux/][df command]], it should look like this,
nicer than the default view.

Alternatively, you can use the [[http://www.jedsoft.org/most/][MOST]] paging program, which works on Unix-like operating systems and supports multiple windows and can scroll left and right.

$ sudo apt install most		#Debian/Ubuntu 
# yum install most		#RHEL/CentOS
# dnf install most		#Fedora 22+

Next, add the line below in your ~/.bashrc file, then source the file like before and possibly reset your terminal.

export PAGER="most"
