How can I see the content of a log file in real time in Linux? Well there are a lot of utilities out there that can help a user to output the
content of a file while the file is changing or continuously updating. Some of the most known and heavily used utility to display a file content in
real time in Linux is the [[https://www.tecmint.com/view-contents-of-file-in-linux/][tail command]] (manage files effectively).

* 1. tail Command – Monitor Logs in Real Time

As said, tail command is the most common solution to display a log file in real time. However, the command to display the file has two versions, as
illustrated in the below examples.

In the first example the command tail needs the -f argument to follow the content of a file.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  $ sudo tail -f /var/log/apache2/access.log
#+END_SRC

The second version of the command is actually a command itself: tailf. You won’t need to use the -f switch because the command is built-in with the
-f argument.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  $ sudo tailf /var/log/apache2/access.log
#+END_SRC

Usually, the log files are rotated frequently on a Linux server by the logrotate utility. To watch log files that get rotated on a daily base you
can use the -F flag to tail command.

The tail -F will keep track if new log file being created and will start following the new file instead of the old file.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  $ sudo tail -F /var/log/apache2/access.log
#+END_SRC

However, by default, tail command will display the last 10 lines of a file. For instance, if you want to watch in real time only the last two lines
of the log file, use the -n file combined with the -f flag, as shown in the below example.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  $ sudo tail -n2 -f /var/log/apache2/access.log
#+END_SRC

* 2. Multitail Command – Monitor Multiple Log Files in Real Time

Another interesting command to display log files in real time is [[https://www.tecmint.com/view-multiple-files-in-linux/][multitail command]]. The name of the command implies that multitail utility can
monitor and keep track of multiple files in real time. Multitail also lets you navigate back and forth in the monitored file.

To install mulitail utility in Debian and RedHat based systems issue the below command.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  $ sudo apt install multitail   [On Debian & Ubuntu]
  $ sudo yum install multitail   [On RedHat & CentOS]
  $ sudo dnf install multitail   [On Fedora 22+ version]
#+END_SRC

To display the output of two log file simultaneous, execute the command as shown in the below example.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  $ sudo multitail /var/log/apache2/access.log /var/log/apache2/error.log
#+END_SRC

[[https://www.tecmint.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Multitail-Monitor-Logs.png]]

* 3. lnav Command – Monitor Multiple Log Files in Real Time

Another interesting command, similar to multitail command is the [[https://www.tecmint.com/lnav-watch-and-analyze-apache-logs-in-linux/][lnav command]]. Lnav utility can also watch and follow multiple files and display
their content in real time.

To install lnav utility in Debian and RedHat based Linux distributions by issuing the below command.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  $ sudo apt install lnav   [On Debian & Ubuntu]
  $ sudo yum install lnav   [On RedHat & CentOS]
  $ sudo dnf install lnav   [On Fedora 22+ version]
#+END_SRC

Watch the content of two log files simultaneously by issuing the command as shown in the below example.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  $ sudo lnav /var/log/apache2/access.log /var/log/apache2/error.log
#+END_SRC

* 4. less Command – Display Real Time Output of Log Files

Finally, you can display the live output of a file with [[https://www.tecmint.com/linux-more-command-and-less-command-examples/][less command]] if you type Shift+F.

As with tail utility, pressing Shift+F in a opened file in less will start following the end of the file. Alternatively, you can also start less
with less +F flag to enter to live watching of the file.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  $ sudo less +F  /var/log/apache2/access.log
#+END_SRC
